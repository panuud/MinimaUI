**ü§´ Want to chat with AI without anyone noticing? Try MinimaUI!**  
It looks just like plain text‚Äîno fancy UI, no distractions, just you and the AI.  

**MinimaUI** is a **minimalistic Next.js web app** that lets you interact with an AI through a simple text field. It keeps your conversation history, manages sessions with cookies, and even allows you to send images to the AI‚Äîall in an ultra-lightweight, no-frills interface.
